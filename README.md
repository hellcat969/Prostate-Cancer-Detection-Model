# Prostate Gland Cancer Detection 

This model is designed to predict Cancer in Prostate Gland based on the 3 values of Cancer detection such as:
 1- ADC values
 2- HBV values
 3- T2w values
 


## Appendix

This dataset is gathered from the authorized personalities based on MRI imaging technology. This dataset is very efficient as it's valued on prostate cancers 3 type recognition. Mostly for the purpose of medical treatments. 

This repository conatins three models source each of which is classified on value bases. This model is showing about 90% accuracy test of validation_testing process. And it makes it much preferable for all the purposes.
